this repository is a monrepo containing all of my code for my submissions to the Fall 2022 CS334, Creative Embedded Systems. it functions as a next.js app deployed to Vercel, to allow much of it to be readible on the web at [cs334.vercel.app](https://cs334.vercel.app) in a publicly-digestible way. the actual code, including submissions and lab logs, can be found in the `misc` folder of the repository.
